# 🎓 Student Record Management System (in C)

A simple C program that manages student records using **file handling** and **for loops only**.  
This is a basic console application where users can add, view, search, and delete student data saved to a `.txt` file.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Add a new student (name, roll number, marks)
- ✅ View all student records
- ✅ Search for a student by roll number
- ✅ Delete a student record
- ✅ Stores data in `students.txt`
- ✅ Built using only `for` loops (no while/do-while)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C**
- Compiler: GCC / Dev C++
- File I/O: `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fclose`
- Concepts: `struct`, `for` loops, file handling, console input/output

---

## 🧩 How to Run

1. Open in **Dev C++** or any C compiler.
2. Save both files in the same folder:
    - `main.c`
    - `student.h`
3. Compile and run (`F11` in Dev C++).
4. Follow the menu in the console.

> Data will be saved in a file called `students.txt` in the same folder.

## 📌 Note

This project was built using `for` loops only — no `while` or `do while` — to strengthen logic-building skills with loop control in C.
